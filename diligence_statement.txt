AI Diligence Statement
In the development of Anthology: The Eight Sentiments, we engaged in extensive collaboration with multiple AI systems including Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, and xAI's Grok.
The base content for this game came from:

The original game design document and rule system created by JJ Knitis
Detailed gameplay mechanics, emotional scoring systems, and narrative frameworks developed through iterative design across multiple AI platforms
Comprehensive game state management and player interaction protocols refined through extensive testing

Throughout this process, the various AI systems assisted with:

Game design iteration and rule refinement (across Gemini, ChatGPT, and Grok)
Gameplay testing and mechanical validation on multiple platforms
Game flow design and conversational interaction patterns
Technical implementation and web application development (Claude Sonnet 4)
Cross-platform compatibility testing and debugging

The human author created the game design, rules, and creative content. The AI systems assisted with development, testing, implementation, and refinement of the human author's original concepts and designs.
All AI-generated implementations and suggestions underwent thorough validation, testing, and refinement by the human author across multiple AI systems. The final game represents a collaborative effort where AI systems provided development and testing capabilities, while the human author created the core content and provided oversight, quality control, and creative direction.
This disclosure is made in the spirit of transparency and to acknowledge the collaborative, multi-AI nature of modern game development.
