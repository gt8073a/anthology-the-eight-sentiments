# 🎲 Non-Determinism as a Feature

*Anthology: The Eight Sentiments* is not deterministic.  
The same word doesn’t always mean the same thing, and that’s the point.

---

## 🌀 What Non-Determinism Means
- A word like **light** can score differently depending on context:  
  - In one round it whispers **Anticipation** (*dawn*).  
  - In another it shouts **Joy** (*holiday lights*).  
- A phrase like **stillness** might feel calming in one theme, unsettling in another.  
- Even two players using the same challenge code can end up with **different journeys**.

**Language is alive.**

## 🎉 Why It’s Fun
- **Ambiguity is play.** Words aren’t fixed tokens. They’re emotional Rorschach tests.  
- **Surprise keeps it fresh.** You can’t just memorize “power words” and solve the game.  
- **Personal resonance matters.** A word that feels neutral to one player can hit deeply for another.  
- **You find your own truth.** Each round becomes a mirror: part poetry, part psychology.

## 🔑 Design Implications
Non-determinism turns *Anthology* into something more than a scoring system:

1. **Replayability**  
   Every round is different. Even the same theme feels new when the words shift.

2. **Discovery**  
   Players stumble into unexpected meanings.

3. **Personalization**  
   There's no “correct score.” It’s about *your score*. Your sweater, your dawn, your version of **shadow**.

4. **Depth**  
   Non-determinism invites reflection: *Why did this word feel different this time? What changed? Me, or the game?*

## 🌟 The Big Idea
**Non-determinism is not a bug, it’s a feature.**  
It makes the game feel less like math and more like music, where the same notes can create infinite songs.  

You don’t just play for points. You play to **find your own truth in a message.**
